Make training messaging appear in one line with steps + losses (look for ideas)

Find how to properly use training validation loops (Does the model instance 
changes inside or you should get it from training loop and pass it to val loop)

1) find noise to implement

2) add noise to the existing noising function

3) visualize the noisy vs the original image

4) find architecture

5) clean code

6) find metrics for denoising

7) find all the parameters you will test and create a csv file make the pipeline
take input from this file
